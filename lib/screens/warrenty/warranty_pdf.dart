The input energy to heat the water is sunlight which we receive from sun and as you know, intensity of the sunlight changes during the year with-respect to change in season. So we request to you all to understand that the performance of solar water heater is depending upon many parameters as given below. 1)  Capacity  of  Solar  Water  Heating  System  with  respect  to  the number of users. 2) Capacity of Solar Water Heating System  with respect to water used by the number of user. 3) The hot water used for Bathing / Washing hands and legs during last night . 4) Intensity of Solar Rays. 5) The temperature of cold water entering in hot water solar tank. 6) Continues Drop leakage from solar water tank. 7) Failure of hot & cold water mixer causing entering the cold water in the hot water tank from    outlet side due to gravity and height of cold  water  tank.  8)  Improper  Cold  Water  Pipeline  (Do  it  as  per sticker given on solar tank). So from above  given detailing,  it is  very much clear to you , that the  effectiveness  of  solar  water  heating  system  is  much  more related to the intensity of heat present in sunlight and performance of solar water heater is also related with various points given above which should be taken care by the customer. We hope that you will understand us , be with us and will enjoy the hot water from solar water heating systems for the clean & healthy life.',
